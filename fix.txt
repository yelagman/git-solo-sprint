Bug fix

Quokka are often dubbed "the happiest animal on Earth"! These small, fluffy marsupials are native to Rottnest Island in Australia and are known for their seemingly permanent smile. Quokkas are about the size of a domestic cat and have round, adorable faces with big, dark eyes. They're herbivores, nibbling on grasses and leaves, and are mostly nocturnal, spending their days resting in the shade. One of their most charming traits is their curious and friendly nature, making them popular with visitors. Their infectious "smile" has made them an internet sensation, and theyâ€™ve gained a reputation for spreading joy wherever they go!
